# rescript-playground

My playground monorepo for learning Rescript.

Current focuses are:

- A starter app with Rescript and React (get-schwifty)

- A leaderboard app with Rescript and React, headless (no backend)

- A NextJS application with Rescript and React (also combining the other apps)
  - Deployed on Vercel
